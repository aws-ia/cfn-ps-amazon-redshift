## Modular architecture for Amazon Redshift

This Quick Start automatically deploys a modular, highly available environment for Amazon Redshift on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in 10-15 minutes.

Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed data warehouse that makes it simple and cost-effective to analyze all your data using standard structured query language (SQL) and your existing business intelligence tools. It enables you to run complex analytic queries against petabytes of structured data, using sophisticated query optimization, columnar storage on high-performance local disks, and massively parallel query execution.

Traditional data warehouses require significant time and resources to administer, especially for large datasets. In addition, the financial cost associated with building, maintaining, and growing self-managed, on-premises data warehouses is very high. Amazon Redshift not only significantly lowers the cost and operational overhead of a data warehouse but, with Redshift Spectrum, also makes it easy to analyze large amounts of data in its native format, without requiring you to load the data.
